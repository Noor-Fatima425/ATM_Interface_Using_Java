The ATM Interface project is a simulation of a real-world ATM system developed using Java. This system enables users to interact with a graphical interface to perform banking operations such as balance inquiry, deposits, withdrawals, and PIN change. The application is designed with a user-friendly interface using Java Swing components and employs event-driven programming to handle user actions.

The project allows users to authenticate through a PIN, and upon successful login, users can access various functionalities through a series of pages. Each page is responsible for different operations, such as entering account details, selecting transaction types, and updating balances. The system also handles errors gracefully, prompting users with appropriate messages when invalid inputs are provided, such as incorrect PINs or insufficient funds.

This ATM interface project mimics the basic functionality of an automated teller machine (ATM), focusing on an intuitive design and user experience while utilizing Java's object-oriented features to ensure modular and scalable code.
